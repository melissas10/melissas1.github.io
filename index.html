                  <h2>Family/Origin</h2>
        <p>I come from a small and calm family of 4. My 2 parents which are Lorena and Jose. I only have one 17 year old brother named Bryan. I currently live with my mom, dad, brother, grandma, and grandpa.</p>
        <p> I have 3 boy cousins from my mom's side, which I am very close to. My mom has 2 siblings. On the other hand, my dad has 5 sisters and 5 brothers including himself. </p>
        <p> My parents come from the country of <strong>MEXICO!</strong> My mom comes from El Salto, Jalisco. My dad is from Nayarit, Jalisco. </p>
      
              <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> One of my many interests is music. Not many people know this about me. I really enjoy listening to music and want to learn more about making music in general. I enjoy to sing in private and only a couple of people have heard me sing. My favorite instrument are the drums. Even though I don't know how to play them I have always enjoyed the sound as a little girl.</p>
        <p> Another interest I have is designing. I have always enjoyed decorating class assignments and basically anything to do with color and creativity. When I grow up I would also like to be an interior designer. Whenever someone asks me to design/decorate something for them I happily accept no matter what it is.</p>
      
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p> Recently I have stopped playing soccer which was my main hobby for my whole life. I played soccer for about 8 years and enjoyed every single year and team I was in. My last year of soccer I didn't really enjoy so I lost interest and quit soccer. Now I really don't have hobbies but I enjoy being outside and playing different kinds of sports. </p>
    
                  <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p> I have 2 major strengths in my life right now. One of them is technology. I have been in an ATM class for 2 years and am still part of it at the moment. This program has changed my knowledge about computers.
            <p>My other strength is in school which is history. I really have a passion for history and enjoy every second I learn about a past event. I excel in history every year since 6th grade and it is my favorite subject.</p>
