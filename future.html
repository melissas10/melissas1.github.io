  <h2> Classroom Model</h2>    
  <p>    For this project, I worked with a partner to create a model of a teacher's classroom on a program called <strong>FloorPlanner </strong>. This is my favorite project because I got to use my creativity and add it to a plain classroom. I love the idea of making my own model of a simple classroom with my creativity. Furthermore, I am proud of this class model because I put alot of my hard work and effort into this and got a really good grade! The one thing that was extremely difficult for me to do was get the exact measurements put inside Floorplanner. Overall this project was really interesting to create!     </p>     <button>Like</button>  </article>  <article>
  
  <h2>SketchUp House</h2>  
  <p>    In addition, this project was created on <strong>SketchUp</strong>, which is a program where you are able to create buildings from scratch. This project is my favorite because it was the first building that we created in SketchUp. The most difficult thing was to create the exact floor measurements and the roof. I really love the fact that this program lets you create buildings from scratch and lets you design it any way you want to. I was sad that the lesson ended that quickly because I really enjoyed it!    </p>    <button>Like</button>  </article>  <article> 
  
  <h2> Big Buck Bunny </h2>   
  <p>   This is one of my favorite projects because I got to work with my peers and get feedback on things that were difficult to accomplish. This project was orignally given to use with all of the animations and no sound whatsoever. Our task was add in precise sound effects and music that goes along with the certain part. This project was really entertaining to create because I got to add all of the sound with my creativity and how I interpreted it in my eyes. Projects that have to deal with my peers are really fun. As a final note, this was my all time favorite project to do in <strong>Garage Band</garage>.
