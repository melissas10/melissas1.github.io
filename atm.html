		<h2>6th Grade </h2>
		<p> When I first entered 6th grade I did not know anything about technology. I learned many skills which included</p>
		<ul>
			
	<li>Typing</li
			<p> 
			 As time passed by I learned how to type using both of my hands without looking down at the keyboard. Now I am really proud of my words per mintue which is 60 wpm.</p>
		<li>Powerpoint</li>
		<p> 
		When we first started power point I was so excited because you get to decorate each slide while learning the content. Powerpoint by far is my best subject. 
		</p>
		<li>Coding</li>
		<p> 
			Coding was my least favorite topic because it was so difficult to get every detail right but now its simple since I have more knowledge about it. For coding you need to have complex mind to understand the concepts. 
		</p>
		<li>Microsoft Word</li>
			<p>
				Microsoft word was pretty boring in my senese because I have experienced it before during elementary school for reports but I learned new skills such as borders and text box shapes.
				
				<h3> 7th Grade </h3>
<li> Photoshop </li>
<p> Photoshop was one of my favorite topics because we had certain projects that included your imagination and creativity to successfully complete it</p>

<li> Sketchup</li>

<li> Floorplanner  </li>
<li> Illustrator </li>
